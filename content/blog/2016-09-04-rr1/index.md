I've broken the promise of writing every day for a few days in a row now, and I'm starting to feel a bit sick of blaming myself for it. So I'm pasting a few passages I'd read today that brightened my day and injected inspiration where it is lacking.

## How to become a great programmer

I googled that, and was presented with 2.44 million results. I picked the first three. Two of them were Quora answers to the exact question I asked, which came with tens of different answers each. I read them all - here are sensible answers among the lot:

- Answers from [Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-become-a-great-programmer), word-for-word:
    
    - Get outside of the “engineering cave” and learn how business works. (checked)
    - 80–20 everything! (I consider myself lazy, so checked)
    - Leverage your technical skills to solve problems that provide huge value. (not yet)
    - You need to put in at least few years into core programming, and work on at least 4-5 good product based projects. (started seriously [learning](https://www.freecodecamp.com/nickangtc) to code in June, so that's 3 months. Far from checking this one)
- From [gamedev.net](http://www.gamedev.net/blog/355/entry-2250592-become-a-good-programmer-in-six-really-hard-steps/):
    
    - Get into the mentality that a day/week/month in which you have not learned something interesting is a failure. There's enough stuff out there that you surely can learn something cool every day. (checked)
    - Write lots of code. At some point when you've made a few projects, read other people's code. (not writing quite as much code as I sometimes feel I am)
    - Specifically, learn a variant of the Lisp programming language, just because it's worth the time to explore the philosophy of good programming. (heard this one before on a Reddit post on coding virtual-reality games - starting to explore this with [The Little Schemer](https://medium.com/getting-technical/day-18-i-know-nothing-1d068aae5c18#.2894oylwd))

As an aside, I just received Steven Pressfield's The War of Art in the mail and have started reading it. Even the prologue got me nodding. Definitely a book worth writing notes on - will do a post on it once I'm done with it, which should be very soon. Its subtitle reads: "Break through the blocks and win your inner creative battles."
