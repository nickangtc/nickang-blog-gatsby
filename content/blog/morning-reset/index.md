I woke up with a messy mind this Saturday morning. It's quiet -- I'm the only one awake, sitting in the living room of our rented apartment in Spain. My thoughts, restless as ever, bounce around the walls.

Yesterday, we met a friend who shared some thoughts about his life plans -- what he wants to achieve between 30 and 40, and what comes after. His words stuck with me.

I'm right in that age range, so I couldn't help but listen intently. And this morning, those ideas have taken over my mind. They've been looping endlessly, asking me questions I'm not sure I can answer.

But this isn't new for me. I've been here before -- letting thoughts run wild, leading nowhere but to a drained body and a restless heart. I know how this story ends.

So I stop. I put everything aside, sit cross-legged on the couch (it's slanted slightly to the right), and close my eyes to breathe.

A few seconds in, I realize it's been ages since I last meditated. I correct my posture -- sitting upright this time -- and rest my palms on my thighs.

It doesn't take long before a thought sneaks in, pulling me away. Then, after a moment, I notice what's happening and choose to let it go.

This happens again. And again. Each time, I gently let the thought drift away like leaves floating downstream.

Here are a few of the thoughts I released in just three minutes:

- Is it time to reinvent my career? Or should I double down on my current path?
- Why can't I just be content with what I have? Everything I need is already here.
- I should've gone to bed last night instead of watching another episode of _Slow Horses_ (Season 2, Episode 1).
- I'm supposed to be creating right now. The timer is running. Twenty minutes, and my laptop isn't even on. Dude.

I take a deep breath.

When I open my eyes, only three minutes have passed. But I feel lighter, like I've just cleaned the kitchen after a messy meal.

Of course, I know this won't last. The chaos will return -- it always does. But maybe there's a way to keep it at bay a little longer.

Ah, there it is again -- a thought.

I let that one go too. Then I pick up a book. I brought only three with me for this month in Spain:

1. _How to Raise Successful People_ by Susan Wojcicki
2. _The School of Life_ by Alain de Botton
3. _Reality Hunger_ by David Shields

Without much thought, I choose #2. Something philosophical feels fitting right now.

Flipping through, I stumble upon two passages that speak directly to me.

One about anxiety:

> The mood is no sign that our lives have gone wrong, merely that we are alive.

And another about solitude:

> We need to be alone because life among other people unfolds too quickly. The pace is relentless: the jokes, the insights, the excitements. There can sometimes be enough in five minutes of social life to take up an hour of analysis.

I pause, and for the first time all morning, I feel calm. The mild anxiety that had been bubbling beneath the surface is almost entirely gone.

Then, in a burst of clarity, I open my email inbox and start unsubscribing from newsletters -- almost all of them. It feels cathartic.

A lot of my self-comparisons come from reading newsletters, I realize. Here's a quick list of what I unsubscribed from:

- Austin Kleon
- Refactoring
- LinkedIn
- Daily Dad
- Wired Daily
- The Economist
- Robert Heaton
- Indie Hackers

There's a Chinese saying: “旧的不去，新的不来” (_jiù de bù qù, xīn de bù lái_), which means you must let go of the old for the new to arrive.

Meditation cleansed my mind.
Unsubscribing cleared my feed.
Reading -- the good stuff -- tickled my brain in the best way.

By the time I set the book down, I find myself more present and yearning less. For the first time this morning, I feel ready to savor the gloriously sunny December Saturday here in Spain, with my family.
