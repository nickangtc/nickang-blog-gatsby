## SQL is for managing and querying data

SQL is a programming language that enables you to retrieve, update, delete, and organise data efficiently.

- Query: retrieve
- Manage: update, delete, organise

What may be surprising is SQL was designed by IBM in the 1970s for **business analysts**, not programmers, so it tries (maybe not terribly well) to resemble plain English.

## Top 3 SQL databases worldwide

For most entrepreneurs, these open-source options dominate ([DB-Engines](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking)):

1. **MySQL**
2. **PostgreSQL**
3. **SQLite**

Open-source means no licensing fees and long-term reliability.

## Tables as the foundation

Data in SQL is stored in _tables_. Think spreadsheets with rows (records) and columns (attributes/fields).

An important differentiator of SQL data is that each column has a defined data type. The common ones are:

- integer
- text
- boolean (true/false)
- timestamp

If you try to insert a boolean value into a text field, you get a slap on the risk and the create/update op will fail with an error.

Another difference is the baked-in understanding of table relationships and validation. This means you can apply a schema that allow only the 'right' data type to be inserted.

A few examples:

- data must be NOT NULL (i.e. not empty)
- data must be UNIQUE (i.e. no other row should have the same value, e.g. ID)
- data must exist as a FOREIGN KEY (i.e. the value here must be an ID in a related table)

## Retrieve data with SELECT

```
SELECT
	first_name,
	last_login_at,
FROM customers
WHERE
	country = "Singapore"
```

This extracts and filters specific rows (customers that are in Singapore) and columns (their first name and last login timestamp).

You could also write all that in a single line. Indentation in SQL is purely for human readability and so is capitalisation (i.e. you can write `select` instead of `SELECT`).

## Combine data with JOIN

You can use `JOIN` operations to combine data. For example, combining a `Customers` table and `Orders` table to find who bought what:

```
SELECT *
FROM customers
JOIN orders
ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;
```

If there were 1000 orders, this query will return 1000 rows and have all columns in `Customers` **and** `Orders` tables.

## Manipulate data with INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

You can add (`INSERT`), change (`UPDATE`), or remove (`DELETE`) data in tables:

For example:

```
INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES ('Laptop', 1200);
```

You probably won't ever insert data into a database yourself using an `INSERT` statement. Either your developers would write code that automates that based on user actions, or you're doing it wrong.

## Ensure data consistency with transactions

**Transactions** allow multiple queries to succeed or fail together.

For example, when a customer places an order in an e-commerce store, you can use a transaction to wrap around the following operations:

- Create new order,
- update inventory (e.g. quantity -1), and
- create payment record (e.g. $100 paid by card).

If creating a `Payments` record succeeds but creating a new row in `Orders` fails, then the database will do a rollback. A **rollback** is a set of reverse operations to bring the relevant tables back to the original state, as if nothing ever happened.

In this case, the database ensures that the new `Payments` record is deleted.

But if all 3 succeed, it'd be as though 3 separate operations just happened successfully.

## Organise data with ORDER BY, GROUP BY, SUM, and COUNT

SQL includes features for sorting (`ORDER BY`), grouping (`GROUP BY`), and aggregating (e.g., `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`).

For example, you can order products by descending price:

```
SELECT
	*
FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC;
```

Or, you can count the number of products that are above 1000 dollars:

```
select COUNT(*) from products where price > 1000;
```

This would output 1 row with 1 column with a single value: the count of products whose prices are above 1000.

## Indexes speed up queries

Indexes act like a database's yellow pages, speeding up data retrieval for frequently queried fields (e.g., customer names or order IDs).

Because of internal optimisations like indexing, you can find 1 row in a table with 1 million rows in less than 1/100th of a second.
