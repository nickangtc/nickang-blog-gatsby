Who has a tight schedule, raise your hands!

And who wants to write and publish content on the web for some inexplicable reason, raise your other hand!

I have both my hands raised like a monkey trying to get attention, that's why I haven't been writing regularly.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

You have a tight schedule - everyone does.

Yet, there _are_ people who do put out things (regularly, even) – but _you_ don't!

My latest excuse is this: I don't like particularly like returning to an incomplete draft, so I have to finish a first draft in a single sitting, otherwise I will throw it in the bin and move on.

That has to some kind of sickness.

When I was in university, it would have been impossible to be like this, because I would have 4-5 hours of uninterrupted time to spend with my mind. In that time I would be able to bang out essays, submit them, and move on.

No binning of work.

But since I raised my left hand – i.e. my schedule is filled with things like 'spend time with the kid' and 'make money' – I have been binning a lot of work.

I've been reflecting a lot in writing, just not publishing them, because of this sickness. Yeah, let's call it what it is. The sickness of one-shotting. The 'Done or Be Done' sickness.

If you can't tell already, I feel like this is an affliction that needs resolution.

I know a bunch of people who are stuck in some loop like mine. I know, because when they speak their excuses, I realise I've made them too. I've been in those loops too:

- the 'write for an audience or write for yourself?' loop
- the 'I need to find my voice' loop
- the 'I can't just be doing this for fun, what's the outcome?' loop
- the 'host on social media, substack, or own blog?' loop

These loops are all illnesses that plague our human minds.

The fact of the matter is, as long as you believe it's helpful (for you, or for others) to write and publish your writing, then you should do it.

Even if it's incomplete.

Even if it's posted on the wrong platform.

Even if you haven't found your voice yet.

Even if you can't see an outcome from all this investment of your time.

If you _feel_ it's helpful, it probably is.

The remedy to all these illnesses is the same: write and publish.

The intrinsic brightness of the thing you produced and put on the internet will shine like UV against bacteria and soon you'll be rid of your affliction.

And you (and a few other human readers?) will be thankful.

Thank you for reading my message to myself.
