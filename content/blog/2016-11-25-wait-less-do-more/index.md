After doing the work--to follow up on a lead or apply for a job--it easily feels like we deserve an answer. That we have cast the net and now we should expect some fishes to swim right in...

But the truth is, those fish may never come.

Life has a rhythm and from what I know, regardless of what that rhythm really is, one thing is certain - it moves forward. The best strategy then is to cast that net and just keep swimming. Don't waste time waiting.

Whenever you feel like that email from the prospective client or employer should be in your inbox _this_ time when you check, resist checking your email. Do something that actually propels you forward instead, and you might just catch the next wave (and a big fish).
