It's important to say the obvious.

Because obvious is not always obvious to everyone.

Because obvious is only obvious at a certain time, in our lives and in a day. Something always comes along and obscures it.

Because the obvious will always slip into oblivion without [timely reminders](/2017-10-04-fierce-and-original/). Like "you should write down how grateful you are each day because it's good for you and those around in [so many ways](https://medium.com/@benjaminhardy/gratitude-journaling-doesnt-really-work-but-this-really-does-though-d1e93a822af1)."

Because we only arrive at the obvious when we have first seen something and thought about it with clarity. Perhaps through [writing daily](/2016-08-19-writing-daily-helping-learn/).

Because things of a trade only [become obvious](/2016-08-30-better-console-log/) when we come close to being masters of that trade. And not everyone is a master yet.

So for these reasons and more, we must not be afraid to say the obvious. We must instead do it so that we can grow, and so can [others](https://www.nickang.com/category/bite-size-programming/).
