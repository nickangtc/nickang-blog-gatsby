A product manager's bread and butter involves (inspired by [Reforge](https://www.reforge.com/blog/product-work-beyond-product-market-fit)):

- Making progress towards product-market fit
- Feature work: creating value by extending a product's functionality and market incrementally into adjacent areas
- Growth work: capturing value by accelerating product adoption in existing markets
- Product-market fit expansion: creating more value by expanding into adjacent products and/or markets

A great product leader would likely be competent at:

- Staying ahead of the curve of customers' evolving pains and desires (esp. with AI tools becoming ubiquitous since ChatGPT)
- Managing stakeholders across the organisation and beyond to persuade, convince, suggest, and push forward changes
- Understanding how technology works to make intelligent decisions
