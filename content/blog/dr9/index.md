Here's what I consider a fact: no matter what you do, some group of people are going to get pissed at you for doing it.

A few examples:

- Someone got pissed at me for writing a review of my Tesla without explicitly stating my disdain for Elon Musk. They assumed that because I drive a Tesla and wrote a positive review that I must approve of the megalomaniac that runs the company.
- Someone on the street was pissed at me for not understanding their gibberish german on the street.
- Someone got pissed at me for ranting on LinkedIn about an incident at work. I never named names.
- Someone is seething that I moved overseas from Singapore while they did not.

I must admit that in a few instances, perhaps someone getting pissed at me was a little more understandable than others.

Like, calling out a coworker on LinkedIn, even if I didn't explicitly state their names, is a little passive aggressive. There may be a good reason to do it, but it's still not the best way to achieve any positive outcome. In that particular case, I honestly wasn't looking for any positive outcome, at least not in terms of my relationship with the people involved.

Which brings me to 2 beliefs of mine that may explain this kind of behaviour:

First, there is such a thing as incompatible personalities. Maybe one person has a particularly fragile ego hidden behind an air of superiority while another person happens to have grown up around someone important who had this exact trait and has a particular disdain for that. Just as liquids like oil and water are immiscible, some people will never get along well and exist separately regardless of how small the container they are forced to be in. The sooner we recognise what kind of liquid we and other people are, the less energy we waste trying to make an impossible concoction.

Second, how someone reacts to something is their responsibility, not mine. The person who was pissed at me for not calling out Elon Musk in my Tesla review article can continue to be pissed at me because how he feels is his responsibility. I do not believe I owe them any of my time to help him feel otherwise. This is the philosophy of the "separation of life's tasks" that psychologist Alfred Adler put forth. It's unpacked nicely in [The Courage To Be Disliked](/2021-01-03-notes-from-the-courage-to-be-disliked-by-kishimi-and-koga).
