Our fingers are dry. My friends and I are in our apartment after their first bouldering session. I suspect they don't know the importance of moisturising the fingers after a climb, so I offer them my aloe vera and olive oil pomade.

This is a dense cream that I bought in a mall in Spain that I use for deep moisturising. When I bought it and first applied a half centimeter of it on my skin, in view of the sales lady who sold it to me, she came up to me with her phone. It had Google Translate translating the sentence: "I forgot to mention, if you still feel a layer of it after rubbing it onto the skin, you're applying too much."

Anyway, back in my apartment, I offer one of my friends the cream. Top unscrewed, ready to be used.

My friend takes a gracious step forward, says thanks, and holds two fingers up. The fingers land on the top of my pomade, her thumb pivoting against the bottle's exterior, and they proceed to dig up a large chunk of cream. It is like a fucking hand excavator. Definitely one of the most barbaric things I'd seen in a while.

This friend of mine scraped up the same amount of cream I'd use in a whole month. For ten fingers.

By some miracle, I manage to summon my facial muscles into a smile and say "you're welcome," but I quickly turn around and screw the lid back on. All I hear in my mind is "what have I done?" and "what the fuck?!"

What I noticed: A comically uncalibrated assault on and waste of my precious pomade.

What I realised: This friend is either too inexperienced to know how to estimate properly, or comes from a rich family and never had to estimate properly.

Why it matters: Your inexperience is revealed through little things. How much you take from a friend's pomade. How overly well-formatted your Slack messages are (experienced people shoot the most poorly formatted but most to-the-point messages). How often you choose to die on hills.

The lesson, I think, isn't that the inexperienced should not do little things (I believe the contrary). It's that lack of experience will inevitably be found out. And the only path to competence and nuance is experience.
