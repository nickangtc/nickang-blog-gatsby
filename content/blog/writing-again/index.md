Here goes nothing! I'm currently writing this in a web app that I've just dreamed up in 5 minutes and was built in bolt.new in a mind-boggling 5 minutes. That's 10 minutes to bring my blur vision of an app to life.

If you've been a developer before the ChatGPT era, you'd know that 10 minutes is not even enough to setup an empty GitHub repository. Whoever continues to say "AI is just producing slop" or "I can code faster than AI" are luddites (a weird term for a technologist) or simply blind.

Anyway, back to the reason I vibe coded this app.

I think I'm going to start writing again.

I've gone to The Dark Side by spending quite a lot of my time lately making videos. First on YouTube then on Instagram. I wouldn't say they left me feeling hollow, but they did make me feel less articulate and powerful. The algorithm dictated so much of what I produced on those platforms. After a while, it gets tiring, you know?

By the way, I'm sure I won't be complaining about this if I didn't have these abysmal numbers from showing up:

- YouTube: 65 subscribers
- Instagram: 10 followers

I'm not leaving those platforms forever. I'm just deciding to spend a little more time in the purest form of human communication, by which I mean through language, i.e. text.

It's just... so much calmer like this. I like it.

Being articulate makes me feel powerful.

And being articulate is:

- topical, meaning you can be articulate at Topic X and terribly versed in Topic Z
- only possible when you've put in the effort to think and convert thoughts into words

What tends to happen when I'm recording myself is that I allocate too much energy and time in the visuals. Where should I stand to talk to the camera? How should I stand? Perhaps it should be a silent video with **text** overlays?

This leaves me with less energy and time to allocate to actually finessing the actual message by going through a thorough "thoughts → words" process.

The downside of writing in 2025 is that it _feels_ like the losing game to play. There's platforms like Sora that go at 1000 BPM, Instagram Reels at 500 BPM, YouTube at 200 BPM, LinkedIn at 150 BPM, news at 100 BPM. Then there's someone's Substack email, which goes, by my estimates, at 20-30 BPM.

How can we "writers" ever compete?

Well, dear reader, you've read this far, haven't you?

Maybe you're a special breed of human. Maybe you and I both are.

Or maybe all of us are that special breed of human and we just need to give ourselves time to awaken from our trance and realise that slow, deliberate writing is what we actually want.
