I recently visited a friend in Switzerland over Christmas.

She has 70k\+ followers on Instagram while holding down a full-time job, an impressive feat.

We're in her living room having dinner together when she casually drops the concept of a "word of the year."

"This year my word has been 'Brave'," she tells us. "This year, after what happened in my life, I've been thinking and have decided that for next year, I will go with the word 'Slow,' as in, to slow down."

I found this idea immediately arresting. I told her as much, saying "wow, you have a word of the year! That's such a great idea!"

A word. For the whole year.

Talk about clarity!

No wishy-washy 10-point new year's resolution. Instead, a single word to hone your energies and guide your inner prioritisation mechanism for the entire year.

Will it work?

Who knows. But heck, if I can't remember a single word to live by for the year, I don't know what I can remember. At least _forgetting_ isn't likely.

And as the title of this posts alluded to, I've decided on a word of the year for 2026.

The word is **strike**.

## Why strike? The short answer

I know attention spans are a little short on the internet nowadays so I'll throw the most obvious (but personal) reason for this choice:

I've never felt more ready to strike. To seize opportunities. No, to _grab_ opportunities, like a lion _ripping_ a gazelle apart.

Now for the slower answer for the more patient reader...

## Why strike? The full answer

The first time I wanted to strike while the iron was hot was 2015 when I first graduated university.

While friends started work, I founded a startup called Flowriter, trying to build a [laptop for writers](/2021-07-04-reflecting-on-my-career-in-tech-5-years-in/).

That didn't go very well because I was way under qualified.

So I trained as a software engineer at a programming bootcamp and, long story short, probably became over-qualified from a career that spanned about 10 years as a software engineer.

Six years in, I landed my dream job at Shopify as a senior engineer, only to be [laid off a year later](/annual-review-2023/).

I spent the remaining 3 years working in order to secure a [permeant residency in Germany](/2020-06-01-why-i-moved-to-berlin/), a piece of plastic that I now possess.

So, I now have all the ingredients I need to strike:

- Security - secured stay in Germany
- Runway - savings from software engineering jobs for about 10 years
- Structure - a bullet-proof daily routine built around my 4 year old child's life
- Free - I quit my job in June 2025

I have no social obligations since I'm living abroad. I'm free to invent myself as I wish.

I have proven to myself over the last 3 years that I'm capable of balancing work and life well, living most days without the regret of "I should have spent more time with my daughter/wife."

I've basically never been readier to strike because **I have a healthier body, a more solid home base (family), a bigger professional network, more savings, more tacit knowledge, and more skills than I've ever had before**.

With all this in place, it's time to go on the offensive. To strike!

## Strike what exactly?

It's an important question. Don't want to become a hammer looking at everything as a nail.

When I hear the verb "strike," it evokes the following:

- Strike while the iron is hot
- Strike when no one is expecting (good business strategy)
- Strike to advance quickly (speed is a feature in AI era)
- Strike to be on the offensive in business
- Strike gold
- Work out regularly to be ready to strike at any time
- Sleep enough to be ready to strike at any time
- Calculate, but with striking in mind

But that doesn't really answer the question. A more direct answer:

- **Friendships and relationships**. Strike out the ones that don't deserve my time
- **Personal finance**. Spend generously on healthy food, sports, tools that provide leverage. Spend less on junk food, TV subscriptions, home appliances and accessories, and restaurants
- **Business**. Prototype and get things in the hands of potential users within days, not weeks or months. Build 10x productivity workflow with AI agents and custom toolset
- **Living**. Say yes to more hare-brained adventure ideas from daughter/wife. Seize any block of 2-3 days of together-time to do interesting things. Banish work-related thoughts/actions during family time. Protect sanctity of 4:30pm cut-off every weekday
- **Personal brand**. Engage fully with those worth engaging with. Write and publish 3x a week on average across LinkedIn, Substack, and [blog](https://nickang.com)

## People who struck (inspiration)

Sean Kochel, an ex-colleague of mine in the same team, who appeared one random day on my YouTube homepage. Clearly someone who is energetic, who saw an opportunity to be a leading voice in AI agents and vibe coding, and seized the opportunity. 29k subscribers on YouTube as of now.

Kenneth Foong, a classmate from junior college in Singapore who declared one day during Chemistry to our teacher that he will run his own restaurant and invite her as a guest (he was always this teacher's pet). He became the head chef of the world's top restaurant Noma and is now on to cooking more culinary delights. We're not even in touch anymore but his story is always first to come to mind when I think of someone who strikes.

My wife, who is trying to transition from a service provider (make up artist) into a media personality on Instagram, who persisted in posting a reel everyday on Instagram for over a month until one day, she broke the 10k views barrier. That same video has since gone viral, hitting 600k\+ views the last time I checked. 2026 will be interesting for her too.

Demis Hassabis, whom I don't (yet) know personally, for pursuing the grandest goals humans dare to pursue while appearing to be unbelievably down to earth and focused. I can't believe he is 49 years old. And I'm also baffled by the view count on the [documentary on his achievements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d95J8yzvjbQ) – only 210,801,179 views since posting 1 month ago.
